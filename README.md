# Fungi

An art generator/simple life simulator. 

Fungi is a tool for me to learn about using some different graphics libraries,
as well as giving me cool new things to look at. Currently written in C++ using
SDL2, which should make it easy to build on different systems. I plan
on creating a ncurses based interface as well as porting to different operating
systems and using their native GUI API.
Inspired by [Culture by Charlotte Koch](https://github.com/dressupgeekout/screensavers/tree/master/culture).

# Building

Currently the only dependency is SDL2, which is assumed to be in the normal
location for Debian/Ubuntu.

```
git clone https://github.com/mlightning3/fungi.git
cd fungi
make
```
